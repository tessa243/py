I hope this email finds you well. I am excited to share the progress and outcomes of our "Automated Incident Analysis" project.
In the current scenario, we faced challenges with manual data extraction from Tableau Server and the time-consuming process 
of generating summary reports for analysis. However, I am pleased to inform you that we have successfully 
implemented an automated approach to streamline this process.

Overview:
With the automated approach, we now extract incident data from Tableau Server
and generate a pivot table representation in an Excel sheet using Selenium in Java. 
This eliminates the need for manual intervention, significantly reducing the time required for data analysis.

Data Extraction and Conversion:
The incident details workbook, which updates daily,
contains approximately 3900 rows and 145 columns of data. However, for our analysis purpose,
we focus only on four relevant columns: INCIDENT NUMBER, OPENED DATE, DESCRIPTION, and SHORT DESCRIPTION. 
We have automated the data extraction process using the Apache POI dependency in Java and converted the downloaded CSV file to an
XLSX file for better data manipulation.

Categorization:
To further enhance the analysis, we have introduced a "category" column based on the "SHORT DESCRIPTION."
 By identifying important terms such as "Wiley Alert," "Threshold," "Job Failure,"
"Job Termination," "Max Retry," and "Max Run Alarm," we categorize incidents accordingly. 
Any incidents that do not fall under these categories are labeled as "Others." This categorization 
simplifies the identification of trends and patterns in the data.

Summary Report:
The generated pivot table in the Excel sheet provides insightful month-wise incident counts for each category, aiding in better decision-making and analysis. This categorized sheet serves as an informative summary report that can be used for further analysis and shared with relevant stakeholders.
